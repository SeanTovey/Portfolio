                        This work is an interactive browser game set in a fictional domed city. 
                        In this city a corporate automated future has been achieved and machines have taken over as the primary labour force. 
                        Luxury goods are in abundance but are not affordable to the majority of people. 
                        I created different social classes and I explored the dynamic between them. 
                        In this capitalist world a paradox is shown when it comes to increasing automation, the more people you can cut out and save money, the less money people will have to buy your goods.
